"But what is a neural network? Chapter 1, Deep learning","Machine learning and neural networks are inspired by the brain. This video explains the structure of a neural network, and the following one explains how it works. In the first video, they put together a network that can learn to recognize handwritten digits. The second video is devoted to the structure and the third one to the learning. The network I'm showing has been trained to recognize digits. It's meant to be similar to how in biological networks of neurons, some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire. The goal is to have some mechanism that could combine pixels into edges or edges into patterns, or patterns into digits. There is a hidden layer of 16 neurons connected to 784 pixel neurons from the first layer, and each one of those 784 connections has its own weight and a bias. The network has almost exactly 130 total weights and biases, 13000 knobs and dials that can be tweaked and turned to make this network behave in different ways. The network is just a function that takes in 784 numbers as an input and spits out ten numbers as a result. It's complicated, but in a way, it's reassuring that it's complicated. In the next video, he'll show how the network learns the appropriate weights and biases based on data and dig a little more into what this particular network is really doing.",Neural networks can recognize numbers.,I1XeDS-GLbg,machine learning neural networks inspired brain video explains structure neural network following one explains works first video put together network learn recognize handwritten digits second video devoted structure third one learning network showing trained recognize digits meant similar biological networks neurons groups neurons firing cause certain others fire goal mechanism could combine pixels edges edges patterns patterns digits hidden layer neurons connected pixel neurons first layer one connections weight bias network almost exactly total weights biases knobs dials tweaked turned make network behave different ways network function takes numbers input spits ten numbers result complicated way reassuring complicated next video show network learns appropriate weights biases based data dig little particular network really,neural networks recognize numbers,14

How a CPU Works,"The CPU is like the brain of the computer. Modern CPUs are measured in gigahertz and turn on several billion times per second. The CPU fits into what's known as the motherboard. On the right of the motherboard is a place called Ram, which contains all the data that's being processed by the CPU. Ram consists of a list of addresses, and at each of those addresses is a piece of data. In Ram, each letter is stored as a combination of ones and zeros according to a character code. The data in Ram consists of instructions, numbers, addresses and letters. Each CPU has its own set of instructions that it understands in and out.

Mastery: How to Learn Anything Fast Nishant Kasibhatla,"In the 1990s, there was no Internet, so the only way to do research in the library was to go to the library. The secret of success of famous people like billionaires, SS and celebrities is that they are committed to learning and dedicated to their goals. Your learning ability decides your earning capacity. If you learn faster, you can go from underpaid to overpaid. For true mastery, you need to focus more on the output rather than the input. The quality of input determines the quality of retention and recall. The best way to learn something is to teach it. When you learn something, just output it and share it with other people. The action is better than no action, according to Nishant.

Neural Networks Pt,"Today on Stackwest, Josh Cameron is going to talk about neural networks and the ReLU activation function. The inspiration for this stack west came from Josh's friend Michael in Svalbard. The neural networks that we've looked at have been simple and only predict whether or not the dosage of a drug will be effective. The more complicated neural networks have more than one input and one output node. When we have two inputs, the neural network creates curved or bent surfaces that are added together to make a new crinkled surface that we can use to make predictions about whether or not the species of an iris is Satosa. When petal or sepal width is close to 04, we get a high value for versicolor double. It's the end of another exciting Stack quest. Now it's time for some shameless self promotion.

Recommender Systems using Graph Neural Networks,"Based on your votes, we will have a look at recommender systems using GNNs today. The main motivation for recommenders is to reduce the huge amount of items to a small, tangible subset. The two most popular classical approaches for recommended systems are content based filtering and collaborative filtering. In the first part of this video, I will talk about classical recommendation methods and then we will look at some examples using GNNs. The model is based on a graph auto encoder. The data set has 18 billion edges and 3 billion nodes. Pins Age is a scalable GNN model that can handle such big graphs by sampling a neighborhood around a node. Social Recommendation is another type of recommendation system that exploits the social network of the users. The task is to predict which item a user is connected to. Next in the graph, the message passing is separated into item user propagations and user item propagations. The long term dependencies are modeled with gated recurrent units and represent general characteristics of a node. The short term dependencies represent the latest properties of a note. The module is stacked several times and used to perform link prediction with a set of candidate items.",Classical recommendations and gnns.,I1XeDS-GLbg,based votes look recommender systems using gnns today main motivation recommenders reduce huge amount items small tangible subset two popular classical approaches recommended systems content based filtering collaborative filtering first part video talk classical recommendation methods look examples using gnns model based graph auto encoder data set billion edges billion nodes pins age scalable gnn model handle big graphs sampling neighborhood around node social recommendation another type recommendation system exploits social network users task predict item user connected next graph message passing separated item user propagations user item propagations long term dependencies modeled gated recurrent units represent general characteristics node short term dependencies represent latest properties note module stacked several times used perform link prediction set candidate items,classical recommendations gnns,0

What Is Docker? What Is Docker And How It Works? Docker Tutorial For Beginners Simplilearn,"Matthew from Simply Learn explains what Docker is and why it should be of value to someone who works in DevOps. Before Docker, a developer would build the code and send it to the tester, but the code wouldn't work on the other system. Due to the differences in computer environments, docker is inherently more lightweight, but provides the same functionality as a virtual machine. The performance of the Docker environment is better and more consistent than the virtual machine, and it's easier to set up and scale. Docker is a tool that allows you to create and run Docker containers. It provides the suitable frameworks for each different application. It's a client and a server relationship between the client and the server. The rest API is used to communicate between the two. The Docker image is built using a file called the Docker file. Docker allows you to create multiple environments for multiple projects. It's highly productive and it's easy to configure. It improves the ability for teams to share environments that are consistent from team to team. The Docker Registry is an open source service site service for hosting and distributing the images that you have defined. So you're creating a consistent operations environment.",Docker vs a developer and a tester.,I1XeDS-GLbg,matthew simply learn explains docker value someone works devops docker developer would build code send tester code would work system due differences computer environments docker inherently lightweight provides functionality virtual machine performance docker environment better consistent virtual machine easier set scale docker tool allows create run docker containers provides suitable frameworks different application client server relationship client server rest api used communicate two docker image built using file called docker file docker allows create multiple environments multiple projects highly productive easy configure improves ability teams share environments consistent team team docker registry open source service site service hosting distributing images defined creating consistent operations environment,docker vs developer tester,41

【Review01】Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting,The motivation for the paper is to derive a traffic prediction in certain horizon. The diffusion convolution is introduced and then nuclear neural network is used to model the nonlinear temporal dynamics. The Encoder decoder architecture is to boost the traffic prediction performance and deal with the long-term prediction problems. The core of graph convolution is the formula from class six spectrograph convolution. It is similar to diffusion convolution or undirected graph. It can be simplified to the summation of graphruction to the power of K multiplied with filter parameter. The north graph should be scaled to minus one to one given the maximum eigenvalue.,Diffusion of prediction in urban networks.,I1XeDS-GLbg,motivation paper derive traffic prediction certain horizon diffusion convolution introduced nuclear neural network used model nonlinear temporal dynamics encoder decoder architecture boost traffic prediction performance deal prediction problems core graph convolution formula class six spectrograph convolution similar diffusion convolution undirected graph simplified summation graphruction power k multiplied filter parameter north graph scaled minus one one given maximum eigenvalue,diffusion prediction urban networks,14
